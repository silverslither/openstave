# OpenStave

Extensible monolithic server for STA races.

## Supported games

* Super Mario Bros. 
    * any%
    * warpless

## Hosting

The public instance is hosted at <https://openstave.ca/>. Contact `silverslither_` on Discord to obtain the race key.

To host OpenStave, create the `env.ts` file in the repo root with the same format as `env.ts.example`. Then, launch with `node server.ts` (tested on Node 24).

## Usage

### Renderer Controls

* Left click: cycle player (main screen), focus player (leaderboard)
* Middle click: reset to focus first place
* Right click: cycle placement (main screen), focus placement (leaderboard)

### Race Creation

On the homepage, fill out all form elements and click Submit to start a new race. You will see the race ID be appended to the end of your URL, and the current status of all players will be printed below the links to the user scripts. Once all user scripts have been distributed (e.g. in a private channel visible to only runners), you may safely reload the page, and the current race status will keep printing under the form (which can still be submitted).

### Running user scripts in Mesen2

`Debug > Script Window` opens a new Lua script window. From within the script window, open `Script > Settings`, and enable:
* Allow access to I/O and OS functions
* Allow network access

Note: with these settings enabled, be careful to not run any scripts from unknown or untrustworthy sources. It is best to inspect all scripts for suspicious looking code.

Then, to run a script, simply `File > Open` the script you wish to run (if necessary, click the triangle icon to run the script - the default settings automatically execute loaded scripts). If it is an OpenStave user script, you should see `[OpenStave] successfully connected` printed to the Mesen2 screen as well as the console in the script window. If an error message is printed, follow the instructions in the error message.
